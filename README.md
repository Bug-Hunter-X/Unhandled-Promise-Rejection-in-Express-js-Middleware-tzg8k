This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of promise rejections within asynchronous middleware.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  This is crucial for preventing application crashes and providing informative error messages to users or logging systems.
